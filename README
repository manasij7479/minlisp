Minlisp is a minimal(and ..and as of now, incomplete) lisp interpreter.
To build just use make (make sure you have a C++11 compatible version of GCC..preferably >=4.6).

The following describes the grammar briefly:
1.All input uses prefix notation and must be enclosed in parentheses as necessary.
	eg: (+ 5 4) 
2.Whitespaces aren't required beside the parentheses, but they are a must between everything else).
	eg: (+ 3 x) is valid but (+3x) isn't.
3.Lists can't take varible arguments now.
	eg: (+ 4 5 6) is invalid but you can always write (+ 4 (+ 5 6))

4.Function definition follows the following syntax..(without the < >`s )
Syntax: (defun <name> <arg_list> <body_list>)
	eg: (defun adder(n) (+ 1 n)) defines a function which returns its argument incremented by 1.
5. Operators, functions etc.. are used in the same way.
	eg: (foo 4) 
6. Conditional Statements 
Syntax: (if <condition_list> <true_list> <false_list>)
The false list is optional and the list evaluates to "nil" if the
condition evaluates to  "nil" and the false list is absent.
	eg: (if(> 5 6)(100)(1000)) will evaluate to "1000"
7.Set global variables with setv
	eg: (setv x 5) will set x to 5
	
A full example: Defining and using a factorial function:
..................
$ ./minlisp
[minlisp](defun factorial(n)(if(< n 2)(1)(* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
factorial
[minlisp](factorial 5)
120
[minlisp]

TODO List
1.String Support (Only numerical(and boolean) operations supported now)
2.User defined Macros
3.Variable argument support for functions.
4.Actually handling exceptions, instead of just showing them(this would require some change in the scope class)
5.Actual Data Types
